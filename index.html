                            Four months ago, I would never have imagined just how much joy, laughter, and love you'd bring into my life. Every day with you is a new adventure, and I feel so lucky to have you by my side. You're not just my partner; you're my best friend, my confidant, my happy place.
                            I'm grateful for every little memory we've made together, the laughter, the quiet moments, and the silly inside jokes. Every moment feels like a page in our story, and I love looking back at each chapter. I'm excited to see where our journey will take us.
                            Here's to us, to four amazing months, and to all the days, months, and years to come. Thank you for making every moment so beautiful and memorable. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I love you now and always.</span>
